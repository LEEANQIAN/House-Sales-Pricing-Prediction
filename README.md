# House-Sales-Pricing-Prediction

- This research is to complete a Kaggle competition about predicting the house sale price in Ames using the provided dataset. Through this data analysis project, I first perform data cleaning with MICE package to impute missing data. Then, I conducted exploratory data anlaysis to visualise the impact of each categorical predictor to the house sales price, as well as the distribution of the numerical predictor. Lastly, I fitted the data with linear regression model, with cross validation and feature selection to help tune my model for a higher R2 in testing data. 

- My final R2 for testing model is 0.9174 (from Kaggle) and my final R2 for training model is 0.9537.
